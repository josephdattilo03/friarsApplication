                <p>
                    One of the beauties of Penn is its rich historical traditions dating back to the school's founding
                    in 1740.
                    I have had the honor of being in Mask and Wig during my time here and have seen firsthand how the
                    experience motivates endless alumni to return to our shows and support us every single year.
                    Friars also has this reputation in terms of its history, its members, and its legacy. Seeing the
                    support for Friars extend far beyond its members' time at Penn makes me infinitely more curious
                    about how the experience brings so many people back.

            <div class="reason-container">
                <h1>People</h1>
                <img class="reason-logo" src="assets/student.svg" />
                <p>
                    The most important part of Friars is its members, who span leaders from across Penn's campus from
                    all different backgrounds.
                    Friars serves as an institution to bring together some of the most interesting yet different people
                    from Penn into the same room. For me, joining that room will mean exploring new sides of Penn that I
                    have not seen, engaging with students that I would never otherwise have had a chance to interact
                    with, and committing to a senior year of new friends that will last a lifetime.

            <p>
                For every senior, this is the year that we must finally face adulthood. It is a scary time, and the
                clock starts ticking toward the end of our Penn undergraduate experience.
                I would enjoy nothing more than to spend my last year at Penn getting to know the people who really truly
                care, the people who care about the groups they lead, the experiences they embark on, and the people
                they meet.
